            "[00:37.000 --> 00:39.000]  So, I'm glad we're inside, though.\n",
            "[00:39.000 --> 00:44.000]  Okay, so lecture four of 6.0001 and 600.\n",
            "[00:44.000 --> 00:46.000]  Quick, quick recap of what we did last time.\n",
            "[00:46.000 --> 00:50.000]  So last time we did a little bit more string manipulations,\n",
            "[00:50.000 --> 00:54.000]  and then we saw how you can use for loops over strings directly, right?\n",
            "[00:54.000 --> 00:59.000]  So instead of having for loops that iterate over range, so 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on,\n",
            "[00:59.000 --> 01:08.000]  you saw that it was more powerful to sometimes use for loops that iterate over string objects directly.\n",
            "[01:08.000 --> 01:10.000]  So that was the first half of the lecture.\n",
            "[01:10.000 --> 01:16.000]  In the second half, we started looking at different ways that you can implement\n",
            "[01:16.000 --> 01:19.000]  the different implementations to the same problem.\n",
            "[01:19.000 --> 01:25.000]  So we saw the problem of finding the cube root, and we saw some implementations.\n",
            "[01:26.000 --> 01:30.000]  We saw the guess and check method and the approximation method.\n",
            "[01:30.000 --> 01:35.000]  And then we looked at what I thought was the most powerful method, which was the bisection method.\n",
            "[01:35.000 --> 01:38.000]  And this one, if you remember, I played a game with someone in the audience\n",
            "[01:38.000 --> 01:42.000]  where I got, where I guessed a number between 0 and 100,\n",
            "[01:42.000 --> 01:47.000]  and we saw that I was able to guess that number really, really quickly, right, using the bisection method.\n",
            "[01:47.000 --> 01:50.000]  And that's the one, that's the method that you're going to implement,\n",
            "[01:50.000 --> 01:54.000]  that you are currently implementing in your problem set.\n",
            "[01:54.000 --> 02:04.000]  Okay, so today, so that sort of finishes introduction\n",
            "[02:04.000 --> 02:07.000]  to some of the more basic mechanisms in Python.\n",
            "[02:07.000 --> 02:10.000]  And today we're going to talk about how to structure your programs,\n",
            "[02:10.000 --> 02:14.000]  such that you write nice, coherent code, reusable code,\n",
            "[02:14.000 --> 02:18.000]  by hiding away some of the details in your code.\n",
            "[02:18.000 --> 02:23.000]  And to do that, we're going to look at these things called functions.\n",
            "[02:24.000 --> 02:29.000]  So just stepping back and sort of getting a high level view of how we write the code so far.\n",
            "[02:29.000 --> 02:34.000]  So so far, the way that you've been writing code for your programs is,\n",
            "[02:34.000 --> 02:38.000]  you open a file, you type some code to solve a particular problem given,\n",
            "[02:38.000 --> 02:41.000]  like in your problem sets.\n",
            "[02:41.000 --> 02:44.000]  Each file contains some piece of code.\n",
            "[02:44.000 --> 02:48.000]  You have sequences of instructions that contain maybe assignments,\n",
            "[02:48.000 --> 02:51.000]  loops, conditionals, and so on and so on.\n",
            "[02:51.000 --> 02:54.000]  You have one file that contains each code,\n",
            "[02:54.000 --> 02:58.000]  and you write everything in that particular file.\n",
            "[02:58.000 --> 03:02.000]  But this is okay for smaller problems that we've been seeing so far,\n",
            "[03:02.000 --> 03:04.000]  but when you're starting to write large pieces of code,\n",
            "[03:04.000 --> 03:07.000]  it's going to get really messy really quickly.\n",
            "[03:07.000 --> 03:12.000]  So think about if you want to use a for loop in one part of your code,\n",
            "[03:12.000 --> 03:16.000]  and you find it useful to use that same for loop in another part of your code,\n",
            "[03:16.000 --> 03:19.000]  at some point in the future, as you're debugging your code,\n",
            "[03:19.000 --> 03:21.000]  you might want to change your original for loop.\n",
            "[03:21.000 --> 03:26.000]  You have to figure out all the other places where you've used that type of for loop, for example.\n",
            "[03:26.000 --> 03:30.000]  So as you're scaling your code,\n",
            "[03:30.000 --> 03:33.000]  you'll find it harder to keep track of these details.\n",
            "[03:33.000 --> 03:36.000]  So this is where functions will come into play in today's lecture.\n",
            "[03:36.000 --> 03:38.000]  It will help you.\n",
            "[03:39.000 --> 03:45.000]  So if you want to be considered a good programmer\n",
            "[03:45.000 --> 03:51.000]  and good programming style would be to not necessarily add lots and lots of lines of code,\n",
            "[03:51.000 --> 03:54.000]  but really to add more functionality to your programs.\n",
            "[03:54.000 --> 03:58.000]  So how many different features can your program do,\n",
            "[03:58.000 --> 04:01.000]  rather than how long can your code be?\n",
            "[04:01.000 --> 04:04.000]  And that'll help you later on look at your code,\n",
            "[04:04.000 --> 04:06.000]  if you need it for a future class,\n",
            "[04:06.000 --> 04:10.000]  and others if they want to look at your code later on if they find it useful.\n",
            "[04:10.000 --> 04:14.000]  So today we're introducing this idea of functions,\n",
            "[04:14.000 --> 04:19.000]  and functions are mechanisms to achieve decomposition and abstraction.\n",
            "[04:19.000 --> 04:23.000]  So these are two key words here that are going to pop up in today's lecture\n",
            "[04:23.000 --> 04:25.000]  and also in future lectures.\n",
            "[04:25.000 --> 04:30.000]  So before I introduce decomposition and abstraction in the context of functions,\n",
            "[04:30.000 --> 04:34.000]  let's first take a look at just sort of a real-life example.\n",
            "[04:34.000 --> 04:37.000]  So let's take a projector. I'm using one right now.\n",
            "[04:37.000 --> 04:40.000]  Quick show of hands.\n",
            "[04:40.000 --> 04:44.000]  If I give you all of the electronic components that are part of a projector,\n",
            "[04:44.000 --> 04:49.000]  resistors, a fan, a light bulb, a lens, the casing,\n",
            "[04:49.000 --> 04:51.000]  all of the different parts in it,\n",
            "[04:51.000 --> 04:57.000]  who here would be able to build a projector?\n",
            "[04:57.000 --> 04:59.000]  Do I see a hand? No?\n",
            "[04:59.000 --> 05:01.000]  Oh, yeah, nice.\n",
            "[05:01.000 --> 05:03.000]  You can also lie. I won't know the difference.\n",
            "[05:03.000 --> 05:06.000]  But if you can do that, I'd be very impressed.\n",
            "[05:06.000 --> 05:10.000]  All right. So you can't really put together a projector, right?\n",
            "[05:10.000 --> 05:12.000]  Another show of hands.\n",
            "[05:12.000 --> 05:15.000]  If I gave you a projector that's fully assembled,\n",
            "[05:15.000 --> 05:17.000]  and I gave you a computer, for example,\n",
            "[05:17.000 --> 05:20.000]  who would be able to maybe figure out within, let's say, an hour\n",
            "[05:20.000 --> 05:23.000]  how to make them work together?\n",
            "[05:23.000 --> 05:26.000]  Good. Fair bit of the class. That's perfect.\n",
            "[05:26.000 --> 05:29.000]  That's exactly the answers I was trying to get at here.\n",
            "[05:30.000 --> 05:36.000]  So none of us really know how a projector works, right, the internals,\n",
            "[05:36.000 --> 05:39.000]  but a lot more of us know how to work a projector, right,\n",
            "[05:39.000 --> 05:42.000]  just given maybe a set of basic instructions\n",
            "[05:42.000 --> 05:45.000]  or just intuitively speaking, okay?\n",
            "[05:45.000 --> 05:48.000]  So you see the projector as sort of a black box, right?\n",
            "[05:48.000 --> 05:51.000]  You don't need to know how it works in order to use it, right?\n",
            "[05:51.000 --> 05:54.000]  You know maybe what inputs it might take,\n",
            "[05:54.000 --> 05:57.000]  what's it supposed to do at a high level, right?\n",
            "[05:57.000 --> 06:01.000]  Take whatever's on my screen and put it up on the large screen there,\n",
            "[06:01.000 --> 06:03.000]  just magnify it.\n",
            "[06:03.000 --> 06:05.000]  But you don't know how it does it, right?\n",
            "[06:05.000 --> 06:07.000]  How the components work together.\n",
            "[06:07.000 --> 06:09.000]  So that's the idea of abstraction, right?\n",
            "[06:09.000 --> 06:13.000]  You don't need to know how the projector works in order to use it.\n",
            "[06:13.000 --> 06:16.000]  Okay. That's abstraction.\n",
            "[06:16.000 --> 06:19.000]  The other half of that was decomposition.\n",
            "[06:19.000 --> 06:22.000]  So let's say that now, given a projector,\n",
            "[06:22.000 --> 06:28.000]  I want to project a very, very large image down on a very large stage.\n",
            "[06:28.000 --> 06:31.000]  For example, this is from one of the Olympics, right?\n",
            "[06:31.000 --> 06:34.000]  It's a stage of like 10 football fields, something like that.\n",
            "[06:34.000 --> 06:36.000]  Something massive, right?\n",
            "[06:36.000 --> 06:39.000]  You could build one projector that's able to project a very large image,\n",
            "[06:39.000 --> 06:41.000]  but that would be really expensive,\n",
            "[06:41.000 --> 06:46.000]  and you'd have to build this one projector that's used for this one time, right?\n",
            "[06:46.000 --> 06:51.000]  So instead what you could do is you could take a bunch of smaller projectors, right?\n",
            "[06:52.000 --> 06:56.000]  And feed different inputs to each one of them,\n",
            "[06:56.000 --> 07:00.000]  and as you're feeding different inputs, each one's going to show a different output,\n",
            "[07:00.000 --> 07:03.000]  and then you're going to be able to have all of these different projectors working together\n",
            "[07:03.000 --> 07:10.000]  to solve this larger problem of projecting this really cool image on a very large stage.\n",
            "[07:10.000 --> 07:16.000]  So that's the idea of decomposition, okay?\n",
            "[07:17.000 --> 07:22.000]  You take the same projector, feed it different inputs.\n",
            "[07:22.000 --> 07:24.000]  It does the exact same thing behind the scenes,\n",
            "[07:24.000 --> 07:29.000]  but it'll produce a different output for each one of these different inputs, right?\n",
            "[07:29.000 --> 07:33.000]  So these different devices are going to work together to achieve the same common goal,\n",
            "[07:33.000 --> 07:37.000]  and that's the idea of decomposition.\n",
            "[07:37.000 --> 07:43.000]  So these were applied to the problem of projecting large image or a projector in general,\n",
            "[07:43.000 --> 07:47.000]  but we can apply these exact same concepts to programming.\n",
            "[07:47.000 --> 07:53.000]  So decomposition is really just the problem of creating structure in your code.\n",
            "[07:53.000 --> 07:58.000]  In the projector example, we have separate devices working together.\n",
            "[07:58.000 --> 08:03.000]  In programming, to achieve decomposition, you're dividing your code into smaller modules.\n",
            "[08:03.000 --> 08:05.000]  These are going to be self-contained,\n",
            "[08:05.000 --> 08:09.000]  and you can think of them as sort of little mini-programs, right?\n",
            "[08:09.000 --> 08:12.000]  You feed in some input to them, they do a little task,\n",
            "[08:12.000 --> 08:14.000]  and then they give you something back.\n",
            "[08:14.000 --> 08:19.000]  They go off and do their thing, and then they give back a result.\n",
            "[08:19.000 --> 08:23.000]  These modules can be used to break up your code,\n",
            "[08:23.000 --> 08:26.000]  and the important thing is that they're reusable.\n",
            "[08:26.000 --> 08:31.000]  So you write a module once, a little piece of code that does something once,\n",
            "[08:31.000 --> 08:33.000]  you debug it once,\n",
            "[08:33.000 --> 08:37.000]  and then you can reuse it many, many times in your code with different inputs.\n",
            "[08:37.000 --> 08:41.000]  Benefit of this is it keeps your code organized\n",
            "[08:41.000 --> 08:44.000]  and it keeps your code coherent.\n",
            "[08:44.000 --> 08:49.000]  So functions are going to be used to achieve decomposition and to create structure in our code.\n",
            "[08:49.000 --> 08:52.000]  We're going to see functions today in this lecture,\n",
            "[08:52.000 --> 08:56.000]  and in a few weeks you're going to actually see when we talk about object-oriented programming\n",
            "[08:56.000 --> 08:59.000]  how you can achieve decomposition with classes,\n",
            "[08:59.000 --> 09:04.000]  and with classes you can create your own object types, like ints and floats.\n",
            "[09:04.000 --> 09:08.000]  You can create your own object types for whatever you want, but that's later.\n",
            "[09:09.000 --> 09:12.000]  So decomposition is creating structure in your code,\n",
            "[09:12.000 --> 09:15.000]  and abstraction is the idea of suppressing details.\n",
            "[09:15.000 --> 09:18.000]  So in the projector example, remember abstraction was\n",
            "[09:18.000 --> 09:21.000]  you didn't need to know exactly how the projector worked in order to use it,\n",
            "[09:21.000 --> 09:24.000]  and it's going to be the same idea in programming.\n",
            "[09:24.000 --> 09:28.000]  So once you write a piece of code that does a little task,\n",
            "[09:28.000 --> 09:30.000]  you don't need to rewrite that piece of code many times.\n",
            "[09:30.000 --> 09:32.000]  You've written it once,\n",
            "[09:32.000 --> 09:36.000]  and you write this thing called a function specification for it, or a doc string.\n",
            "[09:36.000 --> 09:41.000]  And this is a piece of text that tells anyone else who'd want to use it in the future,\n",
            "[09:41.000 --> 09:45.000]  other people, maybe yourself, it tells them how to use this function.\n",

            "[09:51.000 --> 09:54.000]  And what is the output that you're going to get out of it?\n",
            "[09:54.000 --> 09:57.000]  So they don't need to know exactly how you implemented the function.\n",

            "[10:03.000 --> 10:05.000]  Okay.\n",
            "[10:05.000 --> 10:08.000]  So these functions are then reusable chunks of code,\n",
            "[10:08.000 --> 10:15.000]  and we'll see in a few examples today's lecture how to write some and how to call functions.\n",
            "[10:15.000 --> 10:17.000]  And as we're going through today's code,\n",
            "[10:17.000 --> 10:22.000]  I want you to sort of think about functions with two different hats on.\n",
            "[10:22.000 --> 10:26.000]  The first hat is from someone who's writing the function.\n",
            "[10:26.000 --> 10:29.000]  So in the projector example, someone had to build the first projector.\n",
            "[10:29.000 --> 10:32.000]  Someone had to know how to put all these components together.\n",
            "[10:32.000 --> 10:35.000]  So that's going to be you writing a function.\n",
            "[10:35.000 --> 10:38.000]  So you need to know how to make the function work.\n",
            "[10:38.000 --> 10:44.000]  And then the other hat is you as a programmer who's just using the function.\n",
            "[10:44.000 --> 10:47.000]  You're assuming it's already been implemented correctly,\n",
            "[10:47.000 --> 10:50.000]  and now you're just using it to do something.\n",
            "[10:54.000 --> 10:57.000]  So these are some of the function characteristics,\n",
            "[10:57.000 --> 10:59.000]  and we'll see an example on the next slide.\n",
            "[10:59.000 --> 11:01.000]  So a function is going to have a name.\n",
            "[11:01.000 --> 11:03.000]  You have to call it something.\n",
            "[11:03.000 --> 11:04.000]  It's going to have some parameters.\n",
            "[11:04.000 --> 11:06.000]  These are the inputs to the function.\n",
            "[11:06.000 --> 11:09.000]  You can have zero inputs or as many as you'd like.\n",
            "[11:09.000 --> 11:11.000]  Function should have a dock string.\n",
            "[11:11.000 --> 11:13.000]  This is how you achieve abstraction.\n",
            "[11:13.000 --> 11:15.000]  So it's optional but highly recommended,\n",
            "[11:15.000 --> 11:19.000]  and this is how you tell other people how to use your function.\n",
            "[11:19.000 --> 11:23.000]  Function has a body, which is the meat and potatoes of the function,\n",

            "[11:27.000 --> 11:32.000]  It computes its thing, and then it spits back some answer.\n",
            "[11:32.000 --> 11:34.000]  Okay.\n",
            "[11:34.000 --> 11:40.000]  Here's an example of a function definition and a function call.\n",

            "[11:53.000 --> 11:57.000]  So remember, someone has to write the function\n",
            "[11:57.000 --> 11:59.000]  that does something to begin with.\n",
            "[11:59.000 --> 12:01.000]  So this is how you write the function.\n",
            "[12:01.000 --> 12:07.000]  The first is, whoops, the first is going to be this DEF keyword,\n",
            "[12:07.000 --> 12:10.000]  and DEF stands for tells Python,\n",
            "[12:10.000 --> 12:13.000]  I'm going to define a function.\n",
            "[12:13.000 --> 12:16.000]  Next is the name of the function.\n",
            "[12:16.000 --> 12:19.000]  In this case, I'm calling the function is underscore even,\n",
            "[12:19.000 --> 12:23.000]  and the function name should really be something descriptive,\n",
            "[12:23.000 --> 12:26.000]  whereas someone who's just using this function or looking at it\n",
            "[12:26.000 --> 12:28.000]  can pretty much tell what it's supposed to do\n",
            "[12:28.000 --> 12:32.000]  without going a lot further than that,\n",
            "[12:32.000 --> 12:34.000]  than just looking at the name.\n",
            "[12:34.000 --> 12:36.000]  Okay.\n",
            "[12:36.000 --> 12:39.000]  And then in parentheses, you give it any parameters,\n",
            "[12:39.000 --> 12:41.000]  also known as arguments,\n",
            "[12:41.000 --> 12:44.000]  and these parameters are the inputs to the function,\n",
            "[12:44.000 --> 12:48.000]  and then you do colon.\n",
            "[12:48.000 --> 12:49.000]  Okay.\n",
            "[12:49.000 --> 12:53.000]  So this is the first line of the function definition,\n",
            "[12:53.000 --> 12:56.000]  and after this, everything that's going to be part of the function\n",
            "[12:56.000 --> 12:58.000]  is going to be indented.\n",
            "[12:58.000 --> 13:02.000]  The next part is going to be the doc string or the specification,\n",
            "[13:02.000 --> 13:07.000]  and this is how we achieve abstraction using functions.\n",

            "[13:10.000 --> 13:12.000]  and ends with triple quotes,\n",

            "[13:15.000 --> 13:18.000]  It's just going to be text that's going to be visible\n",
            "[13:18.000 --> 13:20.000]  to whoever uses the function,\n",
            "[13:20.000 --> 13:23.000]  and it should tell them the following things.\n",
            "[13:23.000 --> 13:25.000]  What are the inputs to the function?\n",

            "[13:33.000 --> 13:35.000]  Okay.\n",
            "[13:35.000 --> 13:39.000]  The next part is going to be the body of the function.\n",
            "[13:39.000 --> 13:44.000]  We'll talk about what's inside it in the next slide.\n",
            "[13:44.000 --> 13:45.000]  And that's it.\n",
            "[13:45.000 --> 13:48.000]  That's all for the function definition.\n",
            "[13:48.000 --> 13:50.000]  Def, blah, blah, blah,\n",
            "[13:50.000 --> 13:52.000]  indented everything inside the function.\n",
            "[13:52.000 --> 13:53.000]  Okay.\n",
            "[13:53.000 --> 13:57.000]  So this is you writing the function definition.\n",
            "[13:57.000 --> 14:00.000]  Once the function definition is written,\n",
            "[14:00.000 --> 14:02.000]  you can call the function,\n",
            "[14:02.000 --> 14:05.000]  and that's this part down here.\n",
            "[14:05.000 --> 14:08.000]  And here, when you call a function, you just say its name,\n",
            "[14:08.000 --> 14:10.000]  and then you give it parameters,\n",
            "[14:10.000 --> 14:13.000]  and you give it as many parameters as the function is expecting.\n",
            "[14:13.000 --> 14:18.000]  In this case, only one parameter.\n",
            "[14:18.000 --> 14:23.000]  Okay.\n",
            "[14:23.000 --> 14:25.000]  So what's inside the function body?\n",
            "[14:25.000 --> 14:27.000]  You can put anything inside the function body.\n",
            "[14:27.000 --> 14:30.000]  You remember, think of a function as sort of a small procedure,\n",
            "[14:30.000 --> 14:32.000]  a little mini program that does something.\n",
            "[14:32.000 --> 14:34.000]  So you can do anything inside the function\n",
            "[14:34.000 --> 14:36.000]  that you can do in a regular program,\n",
            "[14:36.000 --> 14:40.000]  print things, do mathematical operations, and so on.\n",
            "[14:40.000 --> 14:45.000]  The last line is the most important part of the function, though.\n",
            "[14:45.000 --> 14:47.000]  And it's this return statement.\n",
            "[14:47.000 --> 14:48.000]  That's what we call it.\n",
            "[14:48.000 --> 14:50.000]  So it's a line of code that starts with return,\n",
            "[14:50.000 --> 14:53.000]  which is a key word.\n",
            "[14:53.000 --> 14:56.000]  And then it's going to be some value.\n",
            "[14:56.000 --> 14:57.000]  Okay.\n",
            "[14:57.000 --> 14:58.000]  Notice this is an expression here.\n",
            "[14:58.000 --> 15:00.000]  I percent two is equal equals zero\n",
            "[15:00.000 --> 15:06.000]  is an expression that's going to evaluate to some value.\n",
            "[15:06.000 --> 15:10.000]  And as long as this part is something that evaluates to some value,\n",
            "[15:10.000 --> 15:13.000]  it could be anything you want.\n",
            "[15:13.000 --> 15:16.000]  And this line here, return, something tells Python,\n",
            "[15:16.000 --> 15:21.000]  okay, after you've finished executing everything inside the function,\n",
            "[15:21.000 --> 15:24.000]  what value should I return?\n",
            "[15:24.000 --> 15:28.000]  And whoever called the function is going to get back that value.\n",
            "[15:28.000 --> 15:32.000]  And the function call itself will be replaced by that value.\n",
            "[15:32.000 --> 15:33.000]  Okay.\n",
            "[15:33.000 --> 15:39.000]  So let's look at an example.\n",
            "[15:39.000 --> 15:43.000]  I'm going to introduce the idea of scope now.\n",
            "[15:43.000 --> 15:49.000]  And scope just means is another word for environment.\n",
            "[15:49.000 --> 15:54.000]  So if I told you that you can think of functions as little mini-programs,\n",
            "[15:54.000 --> 16:00.000]  the scope of a function is going to be a completely separate environment\n",
            "[16:00.000 --> 16:03.000]  than the environment of the main program.\n",
            "[16:03.000 --> 16:07.000]  So as soon as you make a function call,\n",
            "[16:07.000 --> 16:09.000]  behind the scenes what Python says is,\n",
            "[16:09.000 --> 16:12.000]  okay, I'm in the main program, but I see a function call.\n",
            "[16:12.000 --> 16:14.000]  I'm going to step out of this main program.\n",
            "[16:14.000 --> 16:17.000]  I'm going to go off into this new environment.\n",
            "[16:17.000 --> 16:19.000]  I'm going to create an entirely new set of variables\n",
            "[16:19.000 --> 16:23.000]  that just exist within this environment.\n",
            "[16:23.000 --> 16:25.000]  I'm going to do some computations.\n",
            "[16:25.000 --> 16:28.000]  When I see the return, I'm going to take this one return value.\n",
            "[16:28.000 --> 16:30.000]  I'm going to exit that environment,\n",
            "[16:30.000 --> 16:34.000]  and then I'm going to come back to the main program.\n",
            "[16:34.000 --> 16:37.000]  So as you're entering from one scope to another,\n",
            "[16:37.000 --> 16:40.000]  you're sort of passing these values back and forth.\n",
            "[16:40.000 --> 16:42.000]  So when you're entering a scope,\n",
            "[16:42.000 --> 16:46.000]  you're passing a variable into the function.\n",
            "[16:46.000 --> 16:48.000]  And when the function is finished,\n",
            "[16:48.000 --> 16:52.000]  you're passing a value back to whoever called it.\n",
            "[16:52.000 --> 16:55.000]  So once again, this top part is the function definition.\n",
            "[16:56.000 --> 16:59.000]  And any arguments for the function definition\n",
            "[16:59.000 --> 17:02.000]  are called formal parameters.\n",
            "[17:02.000 --> 17:03.000]  And they're called formal parameters\n",
            "[17:03.000 --> 17:06.000]  because notice they don't actually have a value yet.\n",
            "[17:06.000 --> 17:08.000]  In the function definition,\n",

            "[20:48.000 --> 20:53.000]  Delete that scope and you're back to wherever you started calling it.\n",
            "[20:53.000 --> 20:55.000]  One warning, though.\n",
            "[20:55.000 --> 20:58.000]  So what happens if there's no return statement?\n",

            "[21:45.000 --> 21:50.000]  just to show you the difference that none and printing and returning makes.\n",
            "[21:50.000 --> 21:53.000]  So here are two functions that I wrote.\n",
            "[21:53.000 --> 21:55.000]  One is even with return.\n",
            "[21:55.000 --> 21:56.000]  That's its name.\n",
            "[21:56.000 --> 21:58.000]  So it's pretty descriptive.\n",
            "[21:58.000 --> 22:02.000]  It's pretty much the same code we saw in the slides.\n",
            "[22:02.000 --> 22:04.000]  It just has this extra little print thing.\n",
            "[22:04.000 --> 22:09.000]  It gets the remainder when i is divided by 2,\n",
            "[22:09.000 --> 22:13.000]  and it returns whether the remainder is equal to 0.\n",
            "[22:13.000 --> 22:18.000]  So it'll either return a true or a false Boolean.\n",
            "[22:18.000 --> 22:21.000]  Okay, so my function call is this.\n",
            "[22:21.000 --> 22:26.000]  I'm saying is even with return with value 3.\n",
            "[22:26.000 --> 22:28.000]  When I make this function call,\n",
            "[22:28.000 --> 22:32.000]  this 3 gets mapped into here, this variable here.\n",
            "[22:32.000 --> 22:35.000]  So i is equal to 3.\n",
            "[22:35.000 --> 22:37.000]  I'm going to print with return,\n",
            "[22:37.000 --> 22:40.000]  and then I'm going to say remainder is equal to 3%2,\n",
            "[22:40.000 --> 22:44.000]  which comes out to value 1 because there's remainder 1.\n",
            "[22:44.000 --> 22:48.000]  And I'm going to return whether 1 is equal to 0, which is false.\n",
            "[22:48.000 --> 22:51.000]  So this line here returns false.\n",
            "[22:51.000 --> 22:53.000]  But am I doing anything with the false?\n",
            "[22:53.000 --> 22:54.000]  Not really.\n",
            "[22:54.000 --> 22:57.000]  It's just sort of sitting in the code here.\n",
            "[22:57.000 --> 23:02.000]  So this gets evaluated to false.\n",
            "[23:02.000 --> 23:03.000]  I'm not printing it.\n",
            "[23:03.000 --> 23:05.000]  I'm not doing any operations with it.\n",
            "[23:05.000 --> 23:06.000]  It's just sitting there.\n",
            "[23:06.000 --> 23:07.000]  So it won't show up anywhere.\n",
            "[23:07.000 --> 23:09.000]  If I want the result to show up somewhere,\n",
            "[23:09.000 --> 23:10.000]  then I have to print it.\n",
            "[23:10.000 --> 23:15.000]  So that's what this next line is doing.\n",
            "[23:15.000 --> 23:18.000]  So that one should be straight forward.\n",
            "[23:18.000 --> 23:21.000]  Even without returns, a little bit trickier, but not too bad.\n",
            "[23:21.000 --> 23:25.000]  I have print without return inside here.\n",
            "[23:25.000 --> 23:29.000]  And then I'm going to get a remainder is equal to i%2.\n",
            "[23:29.000 --> 23:32.000]  And notice that I don't have any return.\n",
            "[23:32.000 --> 23:36.000]  So implicitly, Python's going to add a return none for me like that.\n",
            "[23:36.000 --> 23:40.000]  You don't have to add it.\n",
            "[23:40.000 --> 23:42.000]  So when I make the function call here,\n",
            "[23:42.000 --> 23:45.000]  it's going to do the same thing except the return in this case\n",
            "[23:45.000 --> 23:46.000]  is not going to be a boolean.\n",
            "[23:46.000 --> 23:49.000]  It's going to be this special none.\n",
            "[23:49.000 --> 23:54.000]  So this is going to get evaluated to none.\n",
            "[23:55.000 --> 23:57.000]  Again, I'm not printing it out.\n",
            "[23:57.000 --> 23:59.000]  It's just sitting there.\n",
            "[23:59.000 --> 24:04.000]  If I were to print out the result of that,\n",
            "[24:04.000 --> 24:07.000]  you'd be printing out this value none, which if I run it,\n",
            "[24:07.000 --> 24:12.000]  you'll see here it just prints it out right there.\n",
            "[24:12.000 --> 24:15.000]  So as you're doing your next pset, it's about functions,\n",
            "[24:15.000 --> 24:18.000]  and you're seeing these nuns popping out in some places.\n",
            "[24:18.000 --> 24:21.000]  Check to make sure that you've actually returned something\n",
            "[24:21.000 --> 24:24.000]  as opposed to just printed something inside the function\n",
            "[24:24.000 --> 24:30.000]  like we did here.\n",
            "[24:30.000 --> 24:31.000]  So that's the difference.\n",
            "[24:31.000 --> 24:33.000]  And the last thing I want to mention about this\n",
            "[24:33.000 --> 24:37.000]  is even function is how useful it can be.\n",
            "[24:37.000 --> 24:41.000]  So this is the function as in the slides.\n",
            "[24:41.000 --> 24:45.000]  And once you write the function once,\n",
            "[24:45.000 --> 24:48.000]  you can use it many, many times in your code.\n",
            "[24:48.000 --> 24:51.000]  So here I have, I'm using the function isEven\n",
            "[24:51.000 --> 24:54.000]  to print the numbers between 0 and 19,\n",
            "[24:54.000 --> 24:57.000]  including and whether the number is even or odd.\n",
            "[24:57.000 --> 24:59.000]  So notice this piece of code here.\n",
            "[24:59.000 --> 25:01.000]  Once I've written this function isEven,\n",
            "[25:01.000 --> 25:05.000]  it looks really, really nice, right?\n",
            "[25:05.000 --> 25:08.000]  I have four all the numbers in this range.\n",
            "[25:08.000 --> 25:13.000]  If the number i is even, right,\n",
            "[25:13.000 --> 25:16.000]  this is going to return a true or false.\n",
            "[25:16.000 --> 25:20.000]  For all the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.\n",
            "[25:20.000 --> 25:22.000]  If it's true, then I'm going to print out even,\n",

            "[29:12.000 --> 29:16.000]  We print out inside Funk C,\n",
            "[29:16.000 --> 29:22.000]  and then we return z.\n",
            "[29:22.000 --> 29:25.000]  This is the cool part.\n",
            "[29:25.000 --> 29:29.000]  Inside Funk C, z is Funk A.\n",
            "[29:29.000 --> 29:32.000]  So if you replace z with Funk A,\n",

            "[29:48.000 --> 29:50.000]  So with that being another function call,\n",
            "[29:50.000 --> 29:52.000]  you're going to create another scope,\n",
            "[29:52.000 --> 29:54.000]  and you're going to pop into that one.\n",
            "[29:55.000 --> 29:57.000]  I guess two scopes deep.\n",
            "[29:57.000 --> 29:59.000]  We're trying to figure out where we're going.\n",
            "[29:59.000 --> 30:02.000]  So Funk A's scope is going to be up here.\n",
            "[30:02.000 --> 30:03.000]  So what does Funk A do?\n",
            "[30:03.000 --> 30:06.000]  It just prints out this, and it returns none.\n",
            "[30:06.000 --> 30:12.000]  So we're going to return none to whoever called us, which is Funk C.\n",
            "[30:12.000 --> 30:18.000]  So this line here becomes return none.\n",
            "[30:18.000 --> 30:22.000]  And so this line here is going to return none to whoever called it,\n",
            "[30:22.000 --> 30:25.000]  which was this line down here.\n",
            "[30:25.000 --> 30:28.000]  Oops, I didn't mean to cross it out.\n",
            "[30:28.000 --> 30:32.000]  So that line here is going to print none.\n",
            "[30:32.000 --> 30:35.000]  So if you just go step by step,\n",
            "[30:35.000 --> 30:38.000]  it shouldn't be too bad to try to map what happens\n",
            "[30:38.000 --> 30:42.000]  with variable names and formal parameters and actual parameters.\n",
            "[30:42.000 --> 30:47.000]  That's why I highly recommend pieces of paper and pens.\n",
            "[30:47.000 --> 30:51.000]  One last thing I want to mention about scope,\n",
            "[30:51.000 --> 30:53.000]  before we do another example.\n",
            "[30:53.000 --> 30:57.000]  So there are three sort of situations you might find yourself in.\n",
            "[30:57.000 --> 31:01.000]  The first one is probably the most typical.\n",
            "[31:01.000 --> 31:05.000]  And this is when you define a function,\n",
            "[31:05.000 --> 31:08.000]  and it's using a variable named x in this case,\n",
            "[31:08.000 --> 31:11.000]  that's also defined outside of the function.\n",
            "[31:11.000 --> 31:16.000]  And that doesn't matter because of the idea of scopes.\n",
            "[31:16.000 --> 31:19.000]  So inside the global scope, you can have variables x.\n",
            "[31:19.000 --> 31:21.000]  When you're inside a different scope,\n",
            "[31:21.000 --> 31:23.000]  you can have whatever variable names you want.\n",
            "[31:23.000 --> 31:25.000]  And when you're inside that scope,\n",
            "[31:25.000 --> 31:27.000]  Python's going to use those variable names.\n",
            "[31:27.000 --> 31:30.000]  So they don't interfere with each other at all.\n",
            "[31:30.000 --> 31:33.000]  So in this example, I've defined a variable x is equal to 1,\n",
            "[31:33.000 --> 31:35.000]  and then I increment it,\n",
            "[31:35.000 --> 31:40.000]  and that doesn't interfere with the fact that we have a variable x outside.\n",
            "[31:40.000 --> 31:43.000]  This one's a little bit trickier.\n",
            "[31:43.000 --> 31:48.000]  I define this function g.\n",
            "[31:48.000 --> 31:52.000]  And all g does is access a variable x.\n",
            "[31:52.000 --> 31:54.000]  But notice inside g,\n",
            "[31:54.000 --> 31:58.000]  I've never actually declared or initialized a variable x.\n",
            "[31:58.000 --> 32:01.000]  In this f, I said x is equal to 1.\n",
            "[32:01.000 --> 32:05.000]  But in here, I'm just sort of using x.\n",
            "[32:05.000 --> 32:08.000]  So this does not give you an error.\n",
            "[32:08.000 --> 32:10.000]  In fact, it's okay for you to do this in Python.\n",
            "[32:10.000 --> 32:12.000]  Python says, okay, I'm in this scope,\n",
            "[32:12.000 --> 32:14.000]  but I don't have a variable named x.\n",
            "[32:14.000 --> 32:18.000]  So let me just go into the scope of whoever called me.\n",
            "[32:18.000 --> 32:20.000]  So I'm going to just temporarily hop out of this scope\n",
            "[32:20.000 --> 32:24.000]  and see, is there a variable x outside of me?\n",
            "[32:24.000 --> 32:26.000]  And it'll find this variable x here,\n",
            "[32:26.000 --> 32:28.000]  and it's going to print out its values.\n",
            "[32:28.000 --> 32:33.000]  So that's okay.\n",
            "[32:33.000 --> 32:36.000]  This last example here is actually not allowed in Python,\n",
            "[32:36.000 --> 32:38.000]  similar to this one,\n",
            "[32:38.000 --> 32:42.000]  except that I'm trying to increment a value of x,\n",
            "[32:42.000 --> 32:47.000]  but then I'm also trying to reassign it to the same value of x.\n",
            "[32:47.000 --> 32:53.000]  The problem with that is I never actually initialized x inside h.\n",
            "[32:53.000 --> 32:58.000]  So if I said, if inside h, I said x is equal to 1,\n",
            "[32:58.000 --> 33:00.000]  and then I did x plus equals to 1,\n",
            "[33:00.000 --> 33:03.000]  then it would be this example here, f of y.\n",
            "[33:03.000 --> 33:05.000]  But I didn't do that.\n",
            "[33:05.000 --> 33:10.000]  I just tried to access x and then increment it,\n",
            "[33:10.000 --> 33:12.000]  and then try to reassign it.\n",
            "[33:12.000 --> 33:15.000]  And that's actually not allowed in Python.\n",
            "[33:15.000 --> 33:19.000]  There is a way around it using global variables.\n",
            "[33:19.000 --> 33:23.000]  But it's actually frowned upon to use global variables,\n",
            "[33:23.000 --> 33:29.000]  though global variables are part of the readings for this lecture.\n",
            "[33:29.000 --> 33:32.000]  And the reason why it's not a great idea to use global variables\n",
            "[33:32.000 --> 33:39.000]  is because global variables sort of give you this loophole around scopes.\n",
            "[33:40.000 --> 33:45.000]  So it allows you to write code that can become very messy.\n",
            "[33:45.000 --> 33:48.000]  So using global variables, you can be inside a function\n",
            "[33:48.000 --> 33:53.000]  and then modify a variable that's defined outside of your function.\n",
            "[33:53.000 --> 33:56.000]  And that sort of defeats the purpose of functions\n",
            "[33:56.000 --> 34:00.000]  and using them and writing these coherent modules that are separate.\n",
            "[34:03.000 --> 34:08.000]  That said, it might sometimes be useful to use global variables,\n",
            "[34:08.000 --> 34:13.000]  as you'll see in a couple of lectures from now.\n",
            "[34:13.000 --> 34:15.000]  Okay.\n",
            "[34:15.000 --> 34:16.000]  Cool.\n",
            "[34:16.000 --> 34:19.000]  So let's go on to the last scope example.\n",
            "[34:19.000 --> 34:21.000]  Okay, this slide is here.\n",
            "[34:21.000 --> 34:25.000]  And notice I've bolded, underlined, and italicized the Python tutor\n",
            "[34:25.000 --> 34:28.000]  because I find it extremely helpful.\n",
            "[34:28.000 --> 34:31.000]  So the Python tutor, as I've mentioned in one of the assignments,\n",
            "[34:31.000 --> 34:33.000]  is it was actually developed by grad student here,\n",
            "[34:33.000 --> 34:36.000]  or grad student slash postdoc here.\n",

            "[35:08.000 --> 35:10.000]  I would highly suggest you take a piece of code\n",

            "[36:20.000 --> 36:25.000]  So the first thing in the global scope is this function definition.\n",
            "[36:25.000 --> 36:29.000]  Again, in my global scope, I just have G as some code\n",
            "[36:29.000 --> 36:31.000]  because I have not called it yet.\n",
            "[36:31.000 --> 36:32.000]  Okay.\n",

            "[36:35.000 --> 36:38.000]  So G contains some code.\n",
            "[36:38.000 --> 36:42.000]  So we're done with 75% of that code.\n",
            "[36:42.000 --> 36:46.000]  Next line is X is equal to 3.\n",

            "[36:50.000 --> 36:54.000]  And then I have this Z is equal to G of X.\n",
            "[36:54.000 --> 36:57.000]  This is a function call.\n",
            "[36:57.000 --> 37:00.000]  When I see a function call, I'm going to create a new scope.\n",
            "[37:00.000 --> 37:04.000]  This is the scope of G.\n",
            "[37:04.000 --> 37:12.000]  With the scope of G, I'm mapping variables to actual parameters\n",
            "[37:12.000 --> 37:14.000]  to formal parameters.\n",
            "[37:14.000 --> 37:16.000]  So the first thing I'm doing is I'm saying inside G,\n",
            "[37:16.000 --> 37:20.000]  what is the value of actual parameter X?\n",
            "[37:20.000 --> 37:23.000]  And X is going to be the value 3\n",
            "[37:23.000 --> 37:28.000]  because I've called G of X with X is equal to 3.\n",
            "[37:28.000 --> 37:30.000]  Okay.\n",
            "[37:30.000 --> 37:34.000]  Next, what I see inside this function,\n",
            "[37:34.000 --> 37:37.000]  so this is the inside of the function,\n",
            "[37:37.000 --> 37:40.000]  is this bit here.\n",
            "[37:40.000 --> 37:43.000]  It's another function definition.\n",
            "[37:43.000 --> 37:47.000]  Again, since I'm just defining the function and I'm not calling it,\n",
            "[37:47.000 --> 37:51.000]  all Python C's is H is some code.\n",
            "[37:51.000 --> 37:52.000]  Okay.\n",
            "[37:52.000 --> 37:54.000]  I haven't called the function H yet\n",
            "[37:54.000 --> 37:57.000]  because I'm just defining it here with D.\n",
            "[37:57.000 --> 38:00.000]  So that finishes this part here.\n",
            "[38:00.000 --> 38:04.000]  The next line is X is equal to X plus 1.\n",
            "[38:04.000 --> 38:08.000]  So inside the scope of G, I'm incrementing X to be 4.\n",
            "[38:08.000 --> 38:11.000]  Then I'm printing out this line.\n",
            "[38:11.000 --> 38:14.000]  And then I've reached here H.\n",
            "[38:14.000 --> 38:19.000]  This is actually a function call, and I'm calling H.\n",
            "[38:19.000 --> 38:22.000]  As soon as I make a function call, I'm creating another scope.\n",
            "[38:22.000 --> 38:25.000]  So I'm temporarily going out of the scope of G\n",
            "[38:25.000 --> 38:28.000]  and going into the scope of H.\n",
            "[38:28.000 --> 38:31.000]  So Python knows that H contains some code,\n",
            "[38:31.000 --> 38:34.000]  and now I can go inside H and do whatever I need to do.\n",
            "[38:34.000 --> 38:37.000]  So H doesn't have any parameters,\n",
            "[38:37.000 --> 38:41.000]  so I don't need to populate anything like that in there.\n",
            "[38:41.000 --> 38:46.000]  H does define a variable called X, which is ABC.\n",
            "[38:46.000 --> 38:48.000]  It's a string.\n",
            "[38:49.000 --> 38:53.000]  And then that's all H does.\n",
            "[38:53.000 --> 38:57.000]  What does it return?\n",
            "[38:57.000 --> 38:58.000]  None.\n",
            "[38:58.000 --> 39:01.000]  I heard murmuring, but I think none was what you guys are saying.\n",
            "[39:01.000 --> 39:06.000]  So since there's no return statement, H is going to return none.\n",
            "[39:06.000 --> 39:07.000]  Okay.\n",
            "[39:07.000 --> 39:11.000]  So H returns none back to whoever called it,\n",
            "[39:11.000 --> 39:14.000]  which was this code inside G.\n",
            "[39:14.000 --> 39:16.000]  So that gets replaced with none.\n",
            "[39:17.000 --> 39:19.000]  This circled red H here.\n",
            "[39:19.000 --> 39:23.000]  As soon as H returns, we're going to get rid of that scope.\n",
            "[39:23.000 --> 39:27.000]  All the variables created within it, and we're done with H.\n",
            "[39:27.000 --> 39:29.000]  So now we're back into G,\n",
            "[39:29.000 --> 39:34.000]  and we just finished executing this, and this got replaced with none.\n",
            "[39:34.000 --> 39:39.000]  We're not printing it out, so this doesn't show up anywhere.\n",
            "[39:39.000 --> 39:41.000]  It's just there.\n",
            "[39:41.000 --> 39:45.000]  So we're finished with that line, and the next line is return X.\n",
            "[39:46.000 --> 39:49.000]  So X inside G is four.\n",
            "[39:49.000 --> 39:52.000]  So four gets returned back to whoever called it,\n",
            "[39:52.000 --> 39:54.000]  which was in the global scope here.\n",
            "[39:54.000 --> 39:57.000]  So this gets replaced with four.\n",
            "[39:59.000 --> 40:04.000]  So once we've returned X, we've completely exited out of that,\n",
            "[40:04.000 --> 40:08.000]  the scope of G, and we've come back to whoever called us,\n",
            "[40:08.000 --> 40:12.000]  which was global scope, and we've replaced Z is equal to G of X,\n",
            "[40:12.000 --> 40:15.000]  and that completely got replaced with four, the return value.\n",
            "[40:18.000 --> 40:22.000]  So that's sort of showing the nested functions.\n",
            "[40:22.000 --> 40:25.000]  All right, just circling back to decomposition abstraction.\n",
            "[40:25.000 --> 40:27.000]  This is the last slide.\n",
            "[40:27.000 --> 40:31.000]  You can see, if you look at the code associated with Jay's lecture,\n",
            "[40:31.000 --> 40:36.000]  there's some other examples where you can see just how powerful it is to use functions.\n",
            "[40:36.000 --> 40:38.000]  And you can write really clean and simple code\n",
            "[40:38.000 --> 40:41.000]  if you define your own functions and then just use them later.\n",
            "[40:42.000 --> 40:46.000]  And the beauty of defining your own functions that you can use multiple times later\n",
            "[40:46.000 --> 40:49.000]  is you only have to debug the function once, right?\n",
            "[40:49.000 --> 40:51.000]  I know debugging is not your favorite thing,\n",
            "[40:51.000 --> 40:53.000]  but you only have to debug this one thing once,\n",
            "[40:53.000 --> 40:55.000]  and then you can know that it's right and it works well,\n",
